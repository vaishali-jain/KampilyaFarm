<b>Soil preparation:</b> Wheat requires well-drained soil with good fertility. Before planting, prepare the soil by plowing, harrowing, and leveling. Add organic matter such as compost or manure to improve soil fertility.

<b>Seed selection:</b> Select high-quality, disease-free Sona Moti wheat seeds from a reliable source. It is important to choose the right variety of seeds for your location and climate.

<b>Planting:</b> Plant the seeds in rows with a spacing of about 6-8 inches between the rows. The recommended seeding rate is 100-120 kg per hectare. Plant the seeds to a depth of 2-3 inches.

<b>Fertilizer and Irrigation:</b> Apply fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium based on the soil test results. Irrigate the crop regularly to ensure that the soil remains moist.

<b>Pest and Disease control:</b> Monitor the crop regularly for any signs of pests or diseases. Use appropriate pest and disease control measures such as spraying insecticides or fungicides if necessary.

<b>Harvesting:</b> Sona Moti wheat is ready for harvest when the leaves and stems turn yellow and the grains are hard and dry. Harvest the crop using a combine harvester or a sickle.

It is important to note that the specific growing conditions for Sona Moti wheat may vary depending on your location and climate</li>
